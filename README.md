Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I chose to develop was an inventory management app. The goal of this app is to give users a way to track some sort of inventory they have. Whether this be kitchen supplies or items they keep in their closet, this app can be of use to them.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I tried to keep the UI as basic as possible. It is an inventory app at the end of the day and just needs to be functional. The three screens I created were a login screen, sms notification screen, and the inventory management screen itself. These three screens were all that were necessary to make the app work for users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I used the same process for this app as I do for most projects, taking it one step at a time. Working on small pieces helps me avoid burn out and allows me to take a step back and think about the next step. I think this strategy is amazing in that it can help you solve problems that you once thought were too difficult.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To test the application, I ran it a lot. I tried all sorts of different items to see how well it stored them. I also made sure that removing items would work, and it would stop after all items had been removed. This step managed to bring a lot of errors to light so I could fix them.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
As with any coding project, there were a lot of errors I made. Thankfully we have a tool like the internet and Stackoverflow to help solve these errors. At no point was I completely lost and did not know the step forward thanks to these resources. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the inventory page itself shows the most. It is where everything comes together to complete the actual goal of the app.
